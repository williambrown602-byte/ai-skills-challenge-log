DAILY PROFESSIONAL AI CHALLENGE – February 12, 2026

🏢 Business Scenario
You're working as a business analyst at a mid-market consulting firm that's struggling with proposal win rates (currently 28% vs industry average of 45%).

They need a data-driven system to analyze historical proposal outcomes and optimize future bid decisions to increase win rates and improve resource allocation.

🎯 Objective
Build an intelligent proposal optimization system that analyzes historical bid data to identify win/loss patterns, calculates optimal pricing strategies, and generates bid/no-bid recommendations for new opportunities.

🧩 Technical Requirement
Create advanced statistical models to analyze proposal success factors, implement decision trees for bid recommendations, and build automated scoring algorithms for opportunity assessment.
