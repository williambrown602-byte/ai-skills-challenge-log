DAILY PROFESSIONAL AI CHALLENGE – February 08, 2026

🏢 Business Scenario
You're working for a mid-sized manufacturing company that's struggling with inventory management across 4 warehouses and 200+ SKUs. The purchasing manager reports that 23% of rush orders last quarter were due to stockouts, while warehouse costs have increased 18% due to overstock situations. The CFO needs a data-driven solution to optimize inventory levels, reduce carrying costs, and minimize stockouts before the upcoming board meeting.

🎯 Objective
Build an intelligent inventory optimization system that analyzes historical sales data, seasonal patterns, and supplier lead times to recommend optimal reorder points and quantities, reducing both stockout incidents and excess inventory costs.

🧩 Technical Requirement
Create automated inventory analysis algorithms that process multi-dimensional data (sales history, seasonality, supplier performance) and generate actionable reorder recommendations with confidence intervals and risk assessments.
